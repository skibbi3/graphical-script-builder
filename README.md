# Graphical script builder
Plotly Dash based web application that allows users to write scripts in a set format and automatically updates row numbers and row duration then updates the total duration of the script in minutes and seconds.
Allows saving and loading JSON files and can export as a Word document.

This was made over the weekend as a graphical update to [Script Formatter](https://github.com/skibbi3/Script-Formatter) as practice.
